                    some, developing an effective digital marketing strategy can put your gym directly in front of your
                    target market and help you to retain present members and boost new client acquisition rates.</p>

                    been waiting for. For those of you who feel like your gym marketing strategy is in need of a
                    makeover, we’ve compiled our top five digital marketing tips to help get your facility ahead of the

            <div class="blog-content">
                <h2>Perform extensive market research</h2>
                <p> Market research is all about finding out what you don’t already know about your existing and
                    potential gym members, and it is a crucial step for properly identifying your target audience.</p>

                <p>It isn’t enough to simply assume the age range, income level or even fitness level of your typical
                    client. Seeking answers to specific questions concerning your client demographic can help you to
                    easily break your target market down by gender, age, location and interests.</p>

                <p>Some of the information you will need for your market analysis is publicly available, such as
                    statistical data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Other information can be pulled from social
                    media sites, especially as it relates to the people who follow you. </p>

                <p>As well as these available resources, you can also gain valuable market information by surveying your
                    current customers. Consider asking them what they like about your gym membership program including
                    pricing, location, facility ambience and more. Listen carefully to their responses to gage what they
                    are looking for in their gym experience and what kind of people they are. </p>

                <p>Since you’ll be competing for clients, you should also consider taking a look at what types of
                    fitness marketing your competitors are engaged in. Analyze their strengths and weaknesses by reading
                    online reviews or visiting the facility yourself and learn from their mistakes and successes.</p>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <h2> Invest in targeted paid advertisements</h2>
                <p>With platforms like Google Adwords, Facebook and Instagram, investing in targeted paid advertisements
                    has become a prominent way to pull in specific customers. With these tools, users can narrow down
                    the amount and type of people who see an ad to make sure it lands in front of the right people at
                    the right time. </p>

                <p>Some gym owners avoid this type of advertising because they are daunted by the cost. However, paid
                    advertising can cause a gym’s growth to explode overnight and may be worth the additional expense,
                    if you can afford it. Using targeted paid ads can make it possible to receive several new leads
                    every day and as many as 150 new leads per month. Consider if investing in targeting paid
                    advertisement is right for your facility.</p>

                <h2> Maintain a strong social media profile</h2>
                <p>There are several reasons to <a

                        target="_blank">prioritize your social media presence</a> as a business. Firstly, people who
                    visit social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat enjoy seeing photographs and are
                    typically more inclined to follow profiles that catch their attention with consistent, engaging
                    posts. Consider posting photographs of past or upcoming events with high quality photos that
                    showcase members enjoying themselves at your facility. </p>
                <p>Social media is also the perfect place to celebrate your gym members and share relevant personal
                    interest stories with your followers. Whether it’s a post about someone who has reached their
                    fitness goals or about a gym contest winner, human interest stories are more likely to resonate with
                    your followers than ordinary posts and can add a sense of personality to your business.

                <h2> Launch an email campaign</h2>
                <p>If email marketing isn’t already on your radar, it might be time to look into it. Emails allow you to
                    reach potential customers that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get in touch with. It’s important
                    that you look for ways to build your email list without falling to harmful techniques such as <a

                    visits your website, perhaps offering an incentive in exchange for the information.
                </p>
                <p>Once you build up a targeted email list, you can then use it to promote any number of gym marketing
                    events to your recipients and remain at the forefront of their minds throughout their customer
                    journey. For such a strategy to be successful, make sure the content you are sending out is
                    engaging, concise and informational and be prepared to respond quickly to any emails you receive.

                <h2>Create a user-friendly website and phone app</h2>
                <p> When a potential client is interested in finding out more about your business, one of the first
                    things they will do is check out your website or phone app, so it’s important to make sure both are
                    optimized, responsive and user-friendly. </p>

                <p>Your website needs to be easy to find and easy to use; it should follow key search engine
                    optimization (SEO) practices so that potential customers can find you easily online. Once they find
                    you, your site should be attractive, professional looking and easy to navigate. </p>

                <p>It should have an effective call to action (CTA) that collects as much information as possible from
                    your site visitors. You also might want to think about including blogs and other inbound marketing
                    materials that promote upcoming events and demonstrate why your gym is the best choice.</p>
