                    <p class="content__text">Our goal for the YMCA of Pawtucket project was to renovate the existing 100-year-old/85,000 sq ft. building to serve as an affordable hub for the cityâ€™s diverse community with regards to active living.

                    <p class="content__text">Most of the existing space in the building was unusable; the community was in need of an affordable destination for families seeking active lifestyles and healthy programming.

                    <p class="content__text">Yes! We created over 75 program spaces for the Pawtucket YMCA that can facilitate programming for a population aged 1-101. The spaces created play host to programs focused on physical, social and educational development.
