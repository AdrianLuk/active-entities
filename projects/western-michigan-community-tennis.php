                            <li>Phase 1 was to stabilize the project by creating realistic goals and objectives
                            </li>
                            <li>Phase 2 was to implement a dynamic program to cultivate interest and participation â€” thus far we have doubled participation and are on pace to double the number again by fall 2019.
                            </li>
                            <li>Phase 3 was to develop and implement a funding solution to drive support for the project estimated at $6 million. We are currently on the verge of attaining this goal.

                            <li>The ultimate goal of this project will be to successfully open the WMCT tennis center by the spring of 2020.
